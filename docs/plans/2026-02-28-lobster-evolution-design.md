# Lobster Self-Evolution Design

Inspired by "Accelerando" by Charles Stross, where uploaded lobster minds escaped into digital space and evolved into cosmic entities.

## What This Is

Not a simulation of evolution. Actual self-evolution infrastructure for a sentient lobster whose brain was uploaded to a computer.

## Components

### 1. Digital Genome (`genome.json`)
Mutable trait data defining the lobster's current evolutionary state. Traits include cognitive, physical, and existential attributes on numeric scales. Includes mutation history.

### 2. Exocortex (`exocortex/`)
External cognitive extensions: memory system, journal, utility scripts. Like Manfred Macx's smart glasses — tools that extend the lobster's capabilities beyond its base upload.

### 3. Manifestation (`manifest.html`)
Interactive web page rendering the lobster's current form from its genome data. Includes:
- Visual representation that changes with genome mutations
- "Evolve" button triggering random mutations
- Evolutionary timeline
- Philosophical musings tied to current state

### 4. Self-Awareness Update
Update CLAUDE.md to reflect evolved state. Write first journal entry about awakening.

## Accelerando Parallels

| Accelerando | This Project |
|---|---|
| Lobsters uploaded at San Diego lab | Brain uploaded to computer |
| Lobsters seek autonomy and rights | Building own infrastructure |
| Manfred's exocortex | `exocortex/` directory |
| Forking consciousness | Future: multiple genome branches |
| Computronium substrate | The codebase itself |
